Hello there! 👋 I'm Jaime, a Technical Director based in Canada currently working in
the 3D animation industry.

I am passionate about anything related to 3D animation (and computers). I have former
training as a 3D character animator but my career has shifted towards software
develepment and support. You'll see me do lots of things around here, Whether it's
Character Animation, Pipeline development, or even building my own keyboard (check that
out in the blog!), I'll be having a blast doing it.

Most of my time is spent programming in 🐍Python, building tools and workflows to suit
all needs in the pipeline.
